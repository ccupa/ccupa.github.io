    <h2 class="headerStyle"> Common Mistakes </h2>
    <ol class="listStyle">
        <li><strong>Forgetting to Check Compatability:</strong> Not all parts/components work together. The CPU must match the motherbaord socket and the RAM tyoe must also be supported by the motherboard. </li>
        <li><strong>RAM Not Fully Seated:</strong> RAM sticks need to bu fully seated and clicked into place otherwise the PC may not boot.</li>
        <li><strong>Forgetting the CPU Power Cable:</strong> You may have plugged in the motherboard to get power but the CUP also needs its own power that is near the top of the board.</li>
        <li><strong>Plugging Monitor Into the Wrong Port:</strong> When you use a dedicated graphics card, the monitor must be connected to the CPU and not the motherboard itself.</li>
        <li><strong>Installing the Motherboard Without Standoffs:</strong>  Standoffs help prevent the motherboard from touching your metal case, if the motherboard is not on a standoff then it can short circuit, ruining the motherboard.</li>
        <li><strong>Poor Airflow:</strong> Fans installed poorly or in the wrong direction can trap heat inside, which can cause overheating.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="headerStyle">Quick Tips</h3>
    <ul class="listStyle">
        <li>Read the motherboard manual before connecting cables.</li>
        <li>Install the CPU, RAM, and storage on the motherboard before placing it in the case.</li>
        <li>Keep screws organized to avoid losing them.</li>
        <li>Do not overtighten screws; snug is enough.</li>
        <li>Use cable management to improve airflow.</li>
        <li>Install system drivers after setting up the operating system.</li>
    </ul>
