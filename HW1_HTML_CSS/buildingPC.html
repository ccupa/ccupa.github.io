    <ol class="listStyle">
        <li><strong>READ ALL INFORMATION BEFORE ATTEMPTING ON YOUR OWN</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Prepare your workspace:</strong> Work on a clean surface and avoid building on anything that can create static electricity</li>
        <li><strong>Install CPU onto Motherboard:</strong> Carefully line up the CPU with the socket and lock into place. For more depth on how to do so watch this video. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/iQVQxeapji4"> How to Install CPU onto Motherboard</a></li>
        <li><strong>Install Ram onto Motherboard:</strong> Open RAM slot clips press sticks down until the click into place. Be careful since these can break if too much pressure is applied. Video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/FEdlQpj5xzo"> How to Install RAM onto Motherboard</a></li>
        <li><strong>Install SSD into M.2 slot (if you have one):</strong> Slide SSD into the slot on motherboard and secure with case screw. </li>
        <li><strong>Mount Motherboard into case:</strong> Place onto case standoffs and screw it in (DO NOT OVER TIGHTEN).</li>
        <li><strong>Install the Power Suppply:</strong> Secure into case and route the cables where they need to go.</li>
        <li><strong>Install storage drives(SATA SSD/HDD):</strong> Mount drive in the case drive bay or bracket, then connect the data cable to the motherboard and power to PSU cable.</li>
        <li><strong>Install Graphics Card (GPU):</strong> Insert GPU into the PCIe slot on the motherboard adn secure it to your case.</li>
        <li><strong>Connect all Power and Front Panel Cables:</strong> Plug in all components, 24-pin motherboard power, CPU power, GPU power, and the case front-panel connectors (power button, USB, audio). </li>
        <li><strong>Check cables and Airflow:</strong> Make sure fans can spin freely and are not blocked.</li>
        <li><strong>First Boot Test:</strong> Turn on PC and enter BIOS/UEFI to confirm the components are detected.</li>
        <li><strong>Instal OS and Drivers: Install windows/linux, then install motherbaord and GPU drivers.</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <h4 class="headerStyle"> Common First-Boot Checks</h4>
    <ul class="listStyle">
        <li>Make sure monitor cable is connected to GPU and not the motherboard (a very common mistake).</li>
        <li>Confirm RAM is fully clicked into place.</li>
