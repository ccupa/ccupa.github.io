        When we refer to a PC, we usually mean a desktop computer. Laptops are also considered PCs, but for this build we will be focusing on desktop computers. 
        A PC is a personal computer that is designed for individual use. It typically consists of a central processing unit (CPU), memory (RAM), storage (hard drive or solid-state drive), 
        and various input/output devices such as a keyboard, mouse, and monitor, more on that later. 
        PCs can be used for a wide range of tasks, including gaming, productivity, and multimedia consumption.

    <p class="paragraphStyle">
        Anyone can build a PC, regardless of their technical expertise. They are not only for gamers or tech enthusiasts.
        Building your own PC can be a great way to learn about computer hardware and how it works. 
        It can also be a fun and rewarding project that allows you to customize your computer to your specific needs and preferences.
        In the long run building your own PC can save you money, as you can often get better performance for a lower price than buying a pre-built computer.
